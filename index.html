            <p> I'm a fresh graduate with a diploma in Game Development & Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic.</p>

            <p>I grew up playing games at a young age and started gaming when the first generation of Xbox console was released. From that time, my love for games became stronger and more curious about the world of game making. Not only am I a gamer, but also a binge watcher of Korean dramas and music enthusiast such as K-pop, RnB and a little bit of Jazz. After I completed my GCE 'O' Levels, I made the decision to go into Game Development & Technology. I want to experience what it is like being a Game Programmer and these past few years studying in this course, I gained many valuable skills, not only in programming but also Game Design, Communication and Teamwork. I believe all the knowledge and skill sets that I obtained will help prepare myself when I enter the workforce.</p>

            <p>I have completed my national service as a Staff Assistant in the Singapore Police Force. I am currently looking for opportunities to expand my skills.</p>

            <p>Specialties: C++ | C# | Game Programming | Unity 3D | Game Design</p>
